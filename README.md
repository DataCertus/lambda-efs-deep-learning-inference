# Deep Learning inference with AWS Lambda and Amazon EFS

## Introduction

[Amazon EFS support for AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/06/aws-lambda-support-for-amazon-elastic-file-system-now-generally-/?nc1=h_ls) enables storing large deep learning (DL) framework libraries and models on Amazon EFS and load from Lambda.

This repository shows and example of how to use such capability to host a pre-trained Tensorflow 2 object detection model (SSD) from TensorFlow Hub and execute inferences.

Using EFS and Lambda for deep learning inference requires to execute two steps:

1.	Storing the deep learning libraries and model on EFS
2.	Creating a Lambda function for inference, which loads the libraries and model from the EFS file system

The steps above are executed by deploying the project via the [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and then using [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) for installing the required libraries to EFS.

## Running the example

To run this example:

```
# Install the AWS CDK and bootstrap the target account (if this was never done before)
$ npm install -g aws-cdk
$ cdk bootstrap aws://{account_id}/{region}

```

```
# clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/giuseppeporcelli/lambda-efs-ml-demo.git
$ cd lambda-efs-ml-demo
```

```
# Install packages for the project, build and deploy
$ cd cdk/
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ cdk deploy
```

After deployment, note the output:

```
Outputs:
LambdaEFSMLDemo.LambdaFunctionName = 
LambdaEFSMLDemo-LambdaEFSMLExecuteInference17332C2-0546aa45dfXXXXXX
```

It takes a few minutes for AWS CodeBuild to deploy the libraries and framework to EFS. To test the Lambda function, run this command, replacing the function name:

```
$ aws lambda invoke \
    --function-name LambdaEFSMLDemo-LambdaEFSMLExecuteInference17332C2-0546aa45dfXXXXXX \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
    --payload '{"url": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/310983/pexels-photo-310983.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940"}' \
    --region us-east-1 \
    /tmp/return.json    
```

This is the output:

```
{
    "StatusCode": 200,
    "ExecutedVersion": "$LATEST"
}
```
Here you can check the inferenceâ€™s result:

```
$ tail /tmp/return.json

Additionally, you can use the Jupyter notebook in the [notebook](./notebook) folder to print bounding boxes on images.

### Destroy the stack
